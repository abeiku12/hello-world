# hello-world

I'll be posting the code for some sample Xcode projects that I've done here. Don't expect fully functional apps, this code will mostly be for demonstrating how to use a certain feature in Xcode, or something like that. I'll sometimes write tutorials for creating iOS or Mac apps on my website, and you can check out all the existing tutorials here:
